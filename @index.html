<title>According to the size and memory/storage capacity, computers are of the four types:</title>
</head>
<body>
<font size="9">
<p>1.	Super computer</p>
<P>:- It is the biggest and fastest computer, which mainly designed for complex scientific applications. It has many CPUs (central processing units – main part of a computer) which operate in parallel to make it as a fastest computer. Uses: A super computer is mainly used for following applications:</p>
<P>•	Weathers information</p>
<P>•	Energy management</p>
<P>•	Nuclear energy research</p> 
<P>•	Electronic design</p> 
<P>•	Medicine </p>
<P>•	Petroleum exploration and production</p>
<P>•	Defence </p>
<P>•	Structural analysis</p>
<P>•	Real – time animation</p>
<P>Examples:[1] CRAY3,[2]CRAY XMP -14,[3]NEC- 500,[4]PARAM-9000,[5] PARAM -10000 etc.</p>
<P>2.	Mainframe computer </p>
<P>:- These are very large and fast computers but smaller and slower than super computers .They are used  in a centralized location where many terminals(input/output devices) are connected with one CPU and thus, allow different users to share the single CPU .They have a very high memory  (several hundred  Mega bytes ) and can support thousand of users. Uses : - mainframe computers are mainly used for the following applications :</p>
<P>•	Railway and airline reservations</p>
<P>•	Banking applications </p>
<P>•	Commercial applications of large Industries / Companies.</p>
<P>Examples: - [1]IBM 900,[2]IBM 4381,[3]IBM 4300,[4]IBM ES -9000 etc.</p>
<P>3.	Mini computers</p>
<P>: - These are medium scale, smaller and generally slower than mainframes, they have many terminals which are connected with one CPU and can support many users. The cost of a mini computer is less than compared to mainframe computers. Uses: -Mini computers are mainly used in applications where processing can be distributed among several mini computers rather than using a mainframe computer.</p>
<P>Examples:- [1]PDP – 1,[2]DEC ,[3]Micro VAX,[4]IBMAS /400.</p>
<P>4.	Micro computers</p>
<P>: - It is the smallest digital computer, which uses a micro processor as its CPU. Micro processor is a single chip(integrated circuit) CPU. Micro computer is popularly called as Personal computer [PC]. Uses :- PC can be used both as a stand-alone computer and a terminal in a multi user environment for all types of applications. Micro computers are popularly now-a-days due to very high processing power and memory.</p>
<P>Examples :-[1]IBM PC,[2]Pentium4PC etc.</p>
