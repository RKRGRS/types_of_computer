According to the technology used , computers are of three types:
<P>1.	Analog computers
:- These computers represent and store data in continuously varying physical quantities such as current, voltage or
 frequency. These computers are programmed for measuring physical quantities like pressure, temperature, speed etc.
 and perform computations on these measurements. Uses   :-Analog computers are used mainly for scientific and engineering
 applications. i.e.,</p> 
<p>[1] speedometer</p>
<p>[2]thermometer etc.</p>
<p>2.	Digital computers  
 :- Digital computers represent and store data in discrete quantities or numbers .In these computers ,all processing
 is done in terms of numeric representation(binary digits) of data and information. The user enters data in   decimal
 or character   form it is converted into binary digits (0’s and 1’s). Uses   :-Digital computers are used for commercial;
 educational; scientific and many other types of application.</p>
<p>3.	Hybrid computers
:-Hybrid computers have the technology of the both analog and digital computers. These computers store and process 
analog signals which have been converted into discrete numbers using Analog -to- Digital converters .They can also 
convert the Digital numbers into analog signals or physical properties using Digital-to-Analog converters. Uses :-
 Hybrid computers are mainly used  in medical diagnostics, artificial intelligence(robotics) and Computer aided 
 manufacturing(CAM). i.e.,</p>
<p>[1] CAT scanners(Computerized Axial Tomography</p>
<p>[2]CAM(Computer Aided Manufacturing Device).</p>
